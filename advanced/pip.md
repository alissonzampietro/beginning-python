## Package Manager

* [Installation guide for Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

Pip is the package manager used in python in order to install packages. Packages are pre built functionalities that can be used in your code easily. 

For example, let's say that you want to generate a random number with python. Instead of writing the code yourself, you can use a package called numpy. 

For this you just need to install the library running the following command in the terminal: `pip install numpy`

After that you can use the library in your code:

```python
import numpy as np

np.random.randint(0, 10)
```
